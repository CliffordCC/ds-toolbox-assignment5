# Definition: git status

Explain what is git status useful for?
Git status is useful for seeing the if files are staged, un-staged or if the working directory is clear and up to date. This can be useful if you want to run certain commands that require the working directory to clean such as 'git merge' to ensure that changes are not overwritten when merges made. If can also be useful to know which files need to be staged using 'git add' or which files are ready to commit using 'git commit'.

How can you access the same information provided by this command if you were using the JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal?

In JupyterLab you can go to the 'Git' extension on the left hand side and click on the 'changes' tab in the side bar.
